              This shirt is printed with the text of the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision.
              It's from a website called <a href="https://litographs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Litographs</a> that
              does this with all kinds of text sources.

              If it's the wrong size, let me know, I can exchange it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Full disclosure, I liked it so much when I saw it that I got one for myself too. Sorry for
              twinning.

              These are some models made out of metal. You assemble them by just punching out the perforated
              pieces from the sheet and then snapping them together. Presumably there are some instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't sure if you'd like doing these, but I thought maybe it would be fun to work on them
              together next time we hang out. Or for more entertainment, you can make Chas do it.

              This isn't really a present; I had it hanging up in the room you'd have been in when you

              This is a fairly heavy-duty lock, so hopefully it will keep your next bike from getting stolen.

                The bike itself is not part of this gift; it's just a bike that we had sitting in our shed with a
                flat tire and a broken shifter. The gift is this tally of the number of fucks I literally gave
                while repairing it.

                I confirmed with the bike shop that you <i>can</i> get the bike wet and it will still work.
                Use it as long as you want until you get a better one.

                At first glance this might seem to be bike-locking the barn door after the horse has escaped,
                but I figure Chas has given away by now that there's more to this gift than that. If somehow he
                hasn't, now's the time to ask him.

              This is sort of a post-Christmas gift, inspired by a conversation we had when you came to my parents'
              house. I know you're not that into sweets and maybe Grace or Chas will like this more than you
              will. But vegetarians deserve marshmallows too, and luckily there is Trader Joe's.
